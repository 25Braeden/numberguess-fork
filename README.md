# Guess-the-Number-Game
This is a simple guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides the player with feedback after each guess, letting them know if their guess was too big or too small. The player has a total of 5 guesses to correctly guess the number.

## Usage
To play the game, simply run the program and follow the instructions on the screen. You will be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the program will tell you if your guess was too big or too small. You have a total of 5 guesses to correctly guess the number.

If you correctly guess the number, the program will congratulate you and show you how many games you have won out of how many you have played. If you do not correctly guess the number within 5 guesses, the program will tell you that you lost and show you how many games you have won out of how many you have played.

You can choose to play the game again by typing "yes" when prompted at the end of the game.
